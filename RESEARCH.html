						<p>
						Wind and structural health monitoring is an essential step of the validation of the buffeting theory, which describes the 
						wind-induced response of a structure to atmospheric turbulence. The Lysefjord suspension Bridge has been used since 2013 as a full-scale wind 
						engineering laboratory and is now instrumented with nine 3D sonic anemometers as well as four pairs of tri-axial accelerometers inside the deck. 
						This makes the bridge one of the world's most densely instrumented suspension bridge in terms of wind sensors. 
						A master data logging unit synchronizes all the data into a single data file, which is then continuously transmitted via a mobile net.

						 We are involved in pioneering research to know how Doppler wind lidar technology can be used for wind engineering applications. 
						 Using both long-range and short-range lidar instruments, we have investigated their capability to monitor the wind conditions in Norwegian fjords (Lysefjord and Bjørnafjord).
						 This includes both the characterization of atmospheric turbulence and the estimation of the mean wind velocity and a comparison of such measurement with those from sonic anemometers, whenever possible.

							<h2> Structural Dynamic </h2>

						<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt=""></a>
						<p>
						Similarly to challenges regarding the load and response modelling of offshore wind turbines, bridges on floating supports require an integrated assessment of wind, wave and current loads. 
						We have developed an in-house software for this purpose, which combines the simulation of the turbulence wind field and the associates wind loading, with hydrodynamic loads on a tension leg platform type of bridge foundation, using a finite element model in Abaqus as the basis. 
						The tool, which allows one to study the relative importance of the various environmental factors for the design, will be further developed and adapted to the specific bridge designs.

							<h2>Cable aerodynamic</h2>
						</header>
						<!-- <p style="margin-bottom:4.75em;"> </p> -->
						<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/cable_heidi1.jpg" alt=""></a>
						<p>
						Long-span bridges are normally designed as cable-supported structures, in which cables in different arrangements support bridge deck and transmit the dead, service and environmental loads to supports and foundations. 
						While cables are essential for safe operation of a bridge, they are extremely sensitive to various types of dynamic excitation and thus susceptible to fatigue and other types of damage. 
						The wind-induced vibrations of cables include phenomena such as rain-wind vibrations of stay cables, dry cable galloping, parametric excitation, tower wake excitation of hangers, vortex-induced vibrations, ice- wind vibrations etc. 
						Improved understanding of various types of the vibrations is vital for their effective suppression, by establishing necessary levels of damping to prevent the excessive response. 
						We are involved in the joint international research focusing on the aerodynamic countermeasures to limit the galloping cable vibrations. 
						A novel cable surface design has been proposed and will be further optimized.
