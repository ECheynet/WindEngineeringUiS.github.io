I’m a Marie Curie research fellow in the Department of Mechanical and Structural Engineering and Materials Science at UiS since August 2018. I completed my Bachelor’s degree at the University of California, Santa Barbara and PhD at the Universidade da Coruña in Spain. My thesis was on reliability-based design optimization of long-span bridges under probabilistic flutter constraint. My research interests include design optimization considering uncertainty parameters, structural reliability analysis, and aerodynamic instabilities of bridges.
