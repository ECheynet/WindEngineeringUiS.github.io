I am Professor in structural engineering at the University of Stavanger. 
I hold a PhD in structural engineering from the Norwegian Institute of Technology (now NTNU) and a M.Sc. in structural engineering from the University of Novi Sad, Serbia. 
My main research area is structural dynamics, with emphasis on wind loads and wind-induced vibrations of slender structures. 
The research topics include generation of buffeting loads on bridge box-girders typically used in long-span bridges and methods to capture the wind-structure interaction responsible for bridge flutter, 
from ambient vibration data. I have contributed to a number of wind tunnel studies of long-span bridges in North Europe, as well as several international studies devoted to wind-induced bridge cable vibrations. 
Since 2013 I have been managing UiS field investigations of wind characteristics and wind-induced vibrations at Lysefjord bridge, 
supported by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration as part of the E39 Coastal Highway Route project. 
My involvement in the Norwegian Center for Offshore Wind Energy NORCOWE (2009-2017) inspired pioneering applications of optical remote wind sensing in bridge engineering, 
using so-called lidars, in collaboration with several NORCOWE partners and the Technical University of Denmark.
