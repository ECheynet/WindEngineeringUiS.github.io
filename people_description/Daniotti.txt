I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Mechanical and Structural Engineering and Materials Science of University of Stavanger (UiS) since May 2018. I got my Master's Degree at Politecnico di Milano and completed the thesis in Polimi Wind Tunnel. My research interests are bridge deck aerodynamics, structural dynamics and full-scale monitoring of turbulence.
