I am a post-doc researcher at the Department of Mechanical and Structural Engineering and Materials Science (IMBM) of the University of Stavanger (UiS) since September 2016. 
I completed my PhD at UiS in 2016 on the wind-induced vibrations of the Lysefjord suspension bridge (Norway). 
My areas of interest are full-scale atmospheric turbulence measurements, structural dynamic, vibration monitoring and remote sensing technology.
