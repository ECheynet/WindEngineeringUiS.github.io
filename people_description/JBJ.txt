I am Professor in structural engineering at the University of Stavanger. I hold a PhD in structural engineering from the Norwegian Institute of Technology (now NTNU) and a M.Sc. in structural engineering from the University of Novi Sad, Serbia.
My main research area is structural dynamics, with emphasis on wind loads and wind-induced vibrations of slender structures. The research topics include generation of buffeting loads on bridge box-girders typically used in long-span bridges and methods to capture the wind-structure interaction responsible for bridge flutter, from ambient vibration data.
At present, I am involved in studies of aerodynamics of bridge stay cables in the critical Reynolds number range, in full-scale wind and bridge response monitoring, and in various studies on aerodynamics of wind turbine rotors. I am a member of NORCOWEâ€™s scientific committee and the center management group.
