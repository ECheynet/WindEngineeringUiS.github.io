I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Mechanical and Structural Engineering and Materials Science, at the University of Stavanger (UiS), since September 2019. 
I got my master's degree at TÃ©cnico Lisboa in 2013 and I have worked as a structural engineer in Portugal and in Norway, on the consultant and the client sides, with mostly buildings, bridges and floating bridges. 
My research interests are related to the dynamic response of floating bridges, estimation of wind and wave loads, parametric instabilities and bridge deck aerodynamics and optimization.
